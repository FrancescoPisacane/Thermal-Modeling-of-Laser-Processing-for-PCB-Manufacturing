# Thermal Field Simulation for Vaporization Analysis

This project simulates the temperature field generated by a power source over a surface, particularly focusing on vaporization dynamics. The MATLAB code models the temperature distribution over a 3D domain and applies a temperature limit to identify vaporization zones, where the temperature reaches or exceeds a threshold (the vaporization temperature, `Tvap`). This simulation is essential for understanding heat diffusion and efficiency in applications like laser-based materials processing.

## Project Overview

1. **Thermal Field Calculation**: 
   The code computes the temperature field `T(x, y, z)` generated by a heat source moving across the surface. The model considers parameters like thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, power, and speed. The vaporization temperature (`Tvap`) is set as the maximum threshold, beyond which the temperature in the simulation is capped.

2. **Vaporization Area and Track Width**:
   The code calculates the Vaporization Affected Zone (VAP) width at specific efficiency levels (`η`) by examining the area where the temperature exceeds `Tvap`. It also compares simulated track width with experimentally measured values to adjust efficiency for a closer match.

3. **Efficiency Calibration**:
   The efficiency coefficient is calibrated by comparing the simulated track width with a known measurement. The optimal efficiency minimizes the relative error in track width, which is iteratively calculated over a range of efficiency values.

4. **Penetration Depth Calculation**:
   For deeper insight, the code evaluates penetration depth into the material, visualized in various cross-sections.

## Code Highlights

The code follows these key steps:

1. **Initialization of Parameters**: 
   Defines thermal and process parameters, as well as spatial domain setup for accurate resolution in the simulation.

2. **Temperature Field Calculation**:
   Uses nested loops to compute temperature at each point `(x, y, z)` in the 3D grid, with temperature limited to `Tvap`.

3. **Track Width and Efficiency Calibration**:
   Iteratively adjusts efficiency to minimize error between simulated and measured track widths.

4. **Depth and Width of Vaporization Area**:
   Uses contour plotting to visualize the extent of the vaporization area and calculate its width and depth.
